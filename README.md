Certainly! Let's go through the code line by line:


import numpy as np 
import imageio
import scipy.ndimage
import cv2
import numpy as np: Imports the NumPy library and gives it the alias np. NumPy is used for numerical operations in Python.

import imageio: Imports the imageio library, which provides an easy interface to read and write images in various formats.

import scipy.ndimage: Imports the ndimage module from the SciPy library. This module contains various functions for image processing.

import cv2: Imports the OpenCV library, which is widely used for computer vision tasks, including image processing.


img = "cr7.jpg"
Defines a variable img with the filename "cr7.jpg," which is assumed to be the input image file.
python
Copy code
def rgb2gray(rgb):
    return np.dot(rgb[..., :3], [0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140])
Defines a function rgb2gray that takes an RGB image as input and returns a grayscale version using a weighted sum of the RGB channels.

def dodge(front, back):
    final_sketch = front * 255 / (255 - back)
    final_sketch[final_sketch > 255] = 255
    final_sketch[back == 255] = 255
    return final_sketch.astype('uint8')
Defines a function dodge that combines two images to create a "dodged" image. This function is used for creating a sketch-like effect.

ss = imageio.imread(img)
Reads the image specified by the filename in the img variable using imageio.

gray = rgb2gray(ss)
Converts the RGB image ss to grayscale using the rgb2gray function.

i = 255 - gray
Inverts the grayscale image by subtracting its pixel values from 255.

blur = scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian_filter(i, sigma=15)
Applies a Gaussian blur to the inverted image using the gaussian_filter function from the scipy.ndimage.filters module.

r = dodge(blur, gray)
Combines the blurred image (blur) with the original grayscale image (gray) using the dodge function.

cv2.imwrite('cr7-sketch.png', r)
Writes the resulting image (r) to a file named 'cr7-sketch.png' using the cv2.imwrite function.
